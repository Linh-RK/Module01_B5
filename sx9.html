          <b>This is the first item's accordion body</b>. It is shown by
          default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that
          we use to style each element. These classes control the overall
          appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS or overriding
          our default variables. It's also worth nothing that just about any
          HTML can go within thr
          <span style="color: #ff00ea">.accordion-body</span>, though the
          transition does limit overflow.
